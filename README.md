Tic Tac Toe Console Game

Overview

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game for the console. Players take turns to mark cells in a 3x3 grid by choosing numbers from 1 to 9. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

How to Play

1. Game Start: The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid.
2. Player Symbols: There are two players in the game. One uses 'X' and the other uses 'O'.
3. Turns: Players take turns to place their symbol on an empty cell in the grid by choosing a number from 1 to 9.
4. Winning the Game: The first player to align three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
5. Draw: If all 9 cells are filled and no player has aligned three symbols, the game ends in a draw.

Grid Layout

The grid is numbered as follows:


 1 | 2 | 3
-----------
 4 | 5 | 6
-----------
 7 | 8 | 9
 
When a player selects a number, their symbol ('X' or 'O') will replace the corresponding number on the grid.
